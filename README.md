Note that this is according to a "flat world distance" i.e. only comparing the longitudes and latitudes without considering the curvature and elipticity of the earth and such. It will be an accurate measure locally but not over large distances etc.
This is okey since it's only used as an example of real-world distribution of points (compared to the ones generated by a random variable (uniform or similar)).
